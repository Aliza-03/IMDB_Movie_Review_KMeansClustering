# Movie Review Clustering Using KMeans
This project implements K-means clustering from scratch to group movies based on their ratings and analyzes how well movie genres align within clusters. The project uses the **IMDB Movie Dataset** from Kaggle and clusters the movies into three categories: `Top Rated`, `Average Rated`, and `Low Rated`. 
We then evaluate how these clusters correlate with movie genres.
